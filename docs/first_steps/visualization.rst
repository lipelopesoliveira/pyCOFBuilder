Visualizing the structures generated by pyCOFBuilder
====================================================

The structures generated by pyCOFBuilder can be saved in several different formats, thus, they can be visualized using different softwares.

The CIF files can be visualized with several crystallographic softwares, such as Mercury, VESTA, and Olex2. We recomend the use of VESTA, 
which is a free software.

The PDB files can be visualized with molecular visualization softwares, such as VMD, PyMOL, and Chimera.

The ChemicalJSON files can be visualized with Avogadro, which is a free software.
