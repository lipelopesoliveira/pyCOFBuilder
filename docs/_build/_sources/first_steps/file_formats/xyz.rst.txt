XYZ
===

The XYZ file format is a simple text-based format commonly used to represent molecular structures in three dimensions. 
It typically contains information about the atomic coordinates of a molecule. Each line in the file corresponds to an atom 
and includes the atom's element type, as well as its X, Y, and Z coordinates.

A typical XYZ file might look like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   Number of atoms
   Comment line (optional)
   Element1 x1 y1 z1
   Element2 x2 y2 z2
   ...
   ElementN xN yN zN


- "Number of atoms" indicates the total number of atoms in the molecular structure.
- The "Comment line" is optional and is often used to provide additional information about the file.
- Each subsequent line contains the element type (e.g., C for carbon, H for hydrogen) and the X, Y, and Z coordinates of an atom.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   5
   Water molecule
   O 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000
   H 0.75700 0.58600 0.00000
   H -0.75700 0.58600 0.00000


This XYZ file represents a water molecule with oxygen (O) at the origin and two hydrogen (H) atoms positioned accordingly.

It's crucial to emphasize that the XYZ file format is primarily designed for representing molecular structures rather than 
crystal structures. While it efficiently captures the three-dimensional coordinates of individual atoms within a molecule, 
it lacks the necessary information to describe the periodic arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice. Crystal structures 
involve repeating units in three dimensions, and their representation requires additional information such as unit cell parameters,
symmetry operations, and space group details. Researchers and practitioners dealing with crystallographic data should explore
dedicated file formats like CIF (Crystallographic Information File) or other formats specifically tailored for crystal structures
to ensure accurate representation and analysis of periodic arrangements in a crystal lattice.
